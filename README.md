# Spring Kotlin deepdive

This project is designed to show step by step how to migrate from Java to Kotlin with
Spring Boot step by step:
 * [Step 0](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-deepdive/): Initial Java project
 * [Step 1](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-deepdive/tree/step1): Java to Kotlin
 * [Step 2](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-deepdive/tree/step2): Spring Boot 2
 * [Step 3](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-deepdive/tree/step3): Spring WebFlux
 * [Step 4](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-deepdive/tree/step4): Kotlin routing DSL
 
See [Spring Kotlin support documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/languages.html#kotlin) for more details.
 
## Step 3: Spring WebFlux

* Migrate to Reactive APIs
* Reactor Kotlin extensions
* WebClient
* Rendering
* Add Server-Sent Events example
	* `http POST :8080/api/post/ < post.json`
	* `http DELETE :8080/api/post/spring-framework-5-0-1-available-now`
